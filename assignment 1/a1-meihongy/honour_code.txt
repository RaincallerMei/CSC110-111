REMINDER ABOUT ACADEMIC HONESTY
===========================

Please put an [x] beside all the statements that you agree with below:

[ ] I agree that ALL work I am handing in is my own.

[ ] I agree that I did NOT show others my code, or view other people's code to help me with any aspect of this project (including any tutors outside of the university -- I am aware a lot of these tutors take student code and share it with other students in the same class).

[ ] I am aware that it is okay for me to consult other resources for help and guidance, but if I am copying pieces of code directly from a resource, I MUST cite the source in my code (including if I used code from generative AI tools).

[ ] I am aware that if my code bears an unreasonable similarity to someone else's code, I will be called in for a meeting which could lead to a meeting with the Dean's office and possible disciplinary consequences such as receiving a 0 on the assignment.

[ ] I am aware that any academic offence will be written on my transcript and may affect my future chances and opportunities in academic and professional contexts.

Please type your name below to signify that you agree with all of the above:

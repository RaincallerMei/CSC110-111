\section*{Enhancements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Puzzle System for Locked Locations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Description: Locations like Robarts Rare Books (ID 8) require specific items to unlock. Players must collect prerequisites (library card + professor note) to access them.
        \item Complexity: Medium
        \item Implementation: Added \texttt{locked} and \texttt{required\_items} attributes to Location class (\texttt{game\_entities.py} lines 36-37). Modified movement logic in \texttt{adventure.py} (lines 200-208) to check prerequisites
        \item Changed 40+ lines across 2 files
        \item Demo:
        \begin{verbatim}
        enhancement2_demo = [
            "go north",  # Move to location 2 (Robarts Library Entrance)
            "go north",  # Move to location 5 (Robarts 3rd Floor)
            "go east",  # Attempt to move to location 8 (Robarts Rare Books) - locked
            "go south",  # Move back to location 2 (Robarts Library Entrance)
            "go south",  # Move back to location 1 (Bahen Center Lobby)
            "go east",  # Move to location 3 (Sidney Smith Hall)
            "pick up professor note",  # Pick up the professor note in location 3
            "go west",  # Move back to location 1 (Bahen Center Lobby)
            "go north",  # Move to location 2 (Robarts Library Entrance)
            "pick up library card",  # Pick up the library card in location 2
            "go north",  # Move to location 5 (Robarts 3rd Floor)
            "go east"  # Successfully unlock and move to location 8 (Robarts Rare Books)
        ]
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Weight Management System
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Description: Players can carry max 1.5kg. Items have weights (USB=0.2kg, Mug=0.6kg). Must drop items to manage capacity
        \item Complexity: High
        \item Implementation: Added \texttt{weight} attribute to Items (\texttt{game\_entities.py} line 84). Weight tracking in \texttt{pick\_up\_item()} (lines 104-109) and \texttt{get\_current\_weight()} (line 180). New drop command handling
        \item Changed 40+ lines across 3 files
        \item Demo:
        \begin{verbatim}
        enhancement1_demo = [
            "go north",  # 2
            "pick up usb drive",  # 0.2kg
            "pick up library card",  # 0.1kg (total 0.3)
            "go south",  # 1
            "go east",  # 3
            "pick up professor note",  # 0.1kg (total 0.4)
            "pick up philosophy textbook"  # 0.2kg (total 0.6) - under 1.5kg
        ]
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
